This directory contains the tests for irregex.

To execute all tests, run the following script:

    ./tests/all

This script can be executed from any location, so both ./tests/all and ./all
(assuming you are in tests directory) are valid invocations.

To execute just a specific test suite, run the desired file from the root of the
repository using the appropriate scheme interpret, so for example:

    csi -s ./tests/test-irregex-utf8.scm
