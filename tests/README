This directory contains the tests for irregex.

To execute all tests, run the following script:

    ./tests/all

This script can be executed from any location, so both ./tests/all and ./all
(assuming you are in tests directory) are valid invocations.  Be aware that you
need to have all necessary dependencies configured and available in your PATH.
Assuming you are using Guix, you can run all tests in an appropriate environment
like this:

    guix shell -m manifest.scm -C -- ./tests/all

To execute just a specific test suite, run the desired file from the root of the
repository using the appropriate scheme interpret, so for example:

    csi -s ./tests/chicken-irregex-utf8.scm
